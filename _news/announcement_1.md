Team zetalotus and I (with Blockchomper and Ladboy from the C4 leaderboards) earned #1 in the ZetaChain ALPHA contest "phase 1".  

Rated an "A" for:
> At the level that a professional, top-tier audit firm would produce to a paying customer and addresses the specifications provided by C4

Super proud to earn that with the guys, and proud of the work we did together.  

It was a 3 team private contest where, in 3 nights, we:
- compiled 20 pages of research, instruction, and analysis for the [ZetaChain full-node codebase](https://github.com/zeta-chain/node)
- diagrammed major functionality
- spent hours chatting with the ZetaChain protocol team 
  
All in the pursuit of creating the best docs we could for the upcoming [ZetaChain C4 audit](https://code4rena.com/contests/2023-11-zetachain-alpha-audit), coming November 13th, 2023.
